## About the Project

AutoSummaryAI centers entirely on automating the summarization of text using an end-to-end pipeline built with PyTorch. The research phase is conducted in Jupyter Notebooks, allowing for rapid experimentation and prototyping, while the production-ready modular code is implemented in Python (.py files). With AutoSummaryAI, users can transform dense, lengthy documents into clear, concise summaries, making it an essential tool for researchers and professionals alike.

## Project Workflow

The AutoSummaryAI workflow is designed to transition smoothly from research to production:

1. **Data Ingestion:**  
   Import text data from files, APIs, or other sources.

2. **Research & Experimentation (Jupyter Notebooks):**  
   Prototype and evaluate different text summarization models using interactive notebooks.

3. **Modular Code Development (.py Files):**  
   Consolidate the best performing models and utility functions into reusable Python modules for production deployment.

4. **Preprocessing:**  
   Clean and prepare input text by removing noise, formatting, and tokenizing content efficiently.

5. **Model Training & Summarization:**  
   Train deep learning models using PyTorch and process input text to generate summaries using an end-to-end pipeline.

6. **Post-Processing:**  
   Refine generated summaries to ensure they are coherent and aligned with user-defined specifications.

7. **Deployment & Integration:**  
   Deploy the modular code seamlessly into larger text processing systems or standalone applications.

8. **Feedback Loop:**  
   Continuously improve the summarization models by incorporating user feedback and retraining as necessary.
